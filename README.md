# NodeMCU_Internet-Speed-Indicator
While suffering from slow internet speeds for most people it has became quite a habit to open "Google.com" from time to time and check the response time and predict the internet speed from it. This code does exactly that on NodeMCU ESP8266 based board .It uses two inbuilt LEDs ,one roughly representing the request sent and other representing the request received. Rapid blinking of these LEDs can be assumed as fast response time ,while slow blinking shows slow response time.
Note: Not working while using Android Phones as hotspot.
